# Scratch starter project

To get started:

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to see the app


The application is similar to Scratch except one small difference i.e, in scratch you would need to drag the block slightly below target block, however in this clone you would need to drag OVER the target block to attach/snap each other to run them in sequence.
